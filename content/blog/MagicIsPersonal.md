From our preferred format, to our [psychographic profile](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/the-three-magic-psychographics), our favourite colour identity and even how we choose to sequence your plays: Magic players are expressing themselves at every stage of the game. 

Even at levels where one might assume things remain relatively static or solved, I see examples of player individuality and creativity shine though on the regular:

- There are [formats that haven't changed in 20 years](https://www.premodernmagic.com/) that still are still don't have a fixed meta.
- At a legacy showdown last month, someone beat out tens of thousands of dollars worth of decks with a simple, cheap [burn deck](https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=73824&d=760050&f=LE).
- The local japanese CEDH meta just birthed [a new deck archetype](https://youtu.be/GgJr3NcbIaE?si=QBKdMMdlpxQon5__). Which doesn't happen very often these days!
