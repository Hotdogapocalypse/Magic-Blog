+++

If you're looking to dip your toes in Magic, or the Commander Format for the first time and you've found your way here, that means my plan is working! Welcome! I'm hotdogapocalypse and this is my blog. Please take a look around.

As for getting started with Commander, I only have a few pieces of advice:

- Don't worry about winning! It's really not a good format to play competitively. If you really want to be competitive I would look into [CEDH](), or any of the popular 60 card formats available.
- Focus on having fun! I am going to write an article about optimizing for fun one day but in the mean time I will just say, have fun. Try out lots of things. Figure out what it is about playing that you enjoy and learn how to take advantage of that. [Reading about the different Magic player types](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Player_type) can give you an idea of what to look out for.
