  <p>Did you know that there has been as 51 1 or 2 mana value rare and mythic red creatures printed into standard in since 2020? Hot on the heels of The Last Airbender, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/139/firebending-student">they have just spoiled another one</a> even. When people talk about the state of standard for the last couple years of years there&rsquo;s a lot of blame thrown at <a href="">Commander</a> or <a href="">Universes Beyond</a> influencing card design but no one seems to think about the number of cards being printed into Standard.</p>
<p>Why is that Significant?</p>
<p>Well, compare the <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28st%3Acore+or+st%3Aexpansion%29+is%3Afirstprinting+-is%3Adigital+id%3Ar+r%3Eu+cmc%3C3+t%3Acreature+year%3E2020&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name">number of red 1 and 2 drops</a> released into standard in the last 5 years to the <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28st%3Acore+or+st%3Aexpansion%29+is%3Afirstprinting+-is%3Adigital+c%3Ar+id%3Ar+r%3Eu+cmc%3C3+t%3Acreature+year%3C2020&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name">number before</a>. It&rsquo;s almost just as many! Almost one half, of the total number of red 1 and 2 drops was released in the last five years. At the rate we&rsquo;re going, there will be as many red aggro cards released into standard between 2020 and 2029 as there were between 1993 and 2020.</p>
<p>If you consider the 3 year rotation, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s crazy to assume that there are way more low to the ground value creatures in standard than ever before. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/fjo5l3/ah_master_vivi/">Cards that give you several free moxen per turn</a> aside, it&rsquo;s easy to surmize why the standard meta might have taken a hard shift towards aggressive early game strategies. There&rsquo;s so much consistency and value there now! I think Kai Buddge <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6C-6PFCX-E&amp;t=7s">has the right of it</a>. There needs to be a shift in design in order to accomodate the change in standard rotation. It&rsquo;s not likely Wizards of Coast are going to juice up the power of other archetypes in standard though, more likely we&rsquo;re going to see Red aggro get a little juiced down. We might even already be seeing a little bit of that &ndash;  we&rsquo;ve had 4 limited formats this year where red aggro either wasn&rsquo;t an archetype or just plain sucked! Instead we&rsquo;re seeing <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=oracle-tag%3A%22mana+dork%22+c%3Ar+year%3A2025+is%3Afirstprinting+%28st%3Acore+or+st%3Aexpansion%29&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name">mana dorks every set</a>, a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/162/tannuk-steadfast-second">new sneak attack</a> and a card that is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/spm/76/electro-assaulting-battery">literally a mana battery</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if Wizards wants to balance standard, they&rsquo;re going to have to balance the number of viable early game strategies across sets. Time will tell if they succeed but I have a feeling it will work itself out. These are just growing pains.</p>
