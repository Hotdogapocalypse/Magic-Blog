# Some of my favourite Magic resources:

- [EDHrec](https://edhrec.com): The first place you should go if you're looking for inspiration for a new deck.  

- [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com): The definitive Magic Card Search engine. (Come check out [my article](dead) on beginner scryfall syntax!)  

- Salubrious Snail's [Caluclators](https://www.salubrioussnail.com/calculators) and [Manabase Tool](https://www.salubrioussnail.com/manabase-tool) for checking my deck composition.  

- [This](https://canadianhighlander.ca/2023/07/17/how-to-build-a-manabase-for-singleton-formats/) article on building manabases for singleton formats, with a sweet calculator!  
  


# Some of my favourite Magic podcasts:
- Listen to the [Legendary Creature](https://legendarycreaturepocast.libsyn.com/) Podcast for sane, measured talk about the game of Commander.  

- I recommend going back and listening to the [Commander Theory](https://commandertheory.com/podcasts) archive. It's still one of the all time best.  
  
- I love [Limited Level-Ups](https://limitedlevelups.libsyn.com/) for learning more about improving as a limited player and deckbuilder.  

- Likewise for [Rough Drafts](https://linktr.ee/roughdrafts). Especially if you want to learn more about hoe general Magic design and theory ideas apply to limited.
